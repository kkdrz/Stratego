# Stratego

A simple web game (kind of tic-tac-toe) built with Vue.js

AI player is implemented in Java and accessed via HTTP endpoint.

## Directories
'frontend' - whole game mechanism, UI, Engine

'backend' - AI feature, playing without this module is possible, but only in mode Human vs. Human

## Deployed apps:

*Sometimes it is needed to wait until Heroku build both apps. Because it shutdowns them if not used some time.*
